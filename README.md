The program prompts the user to enter an operator (e.g., +, -, *, /).
It reads the operator using scanf.
Next, the program prompts the user to enter two numbers.
It reads the two numbers using scanf.
Inside the switch statement:
If the operator is ‘+’, it adds num1 and num2.
If the operator is ‘-’, it subtracts num2 from num1.
If the operator is ‘*’, it multiplies num1 and num2.
If the operator is ‘/’, it checks if num2 is zero (to avoid division by zero) and then divides num1 by num2.
If the operator is invalid, it prints “Invalid operator.”
Finally, the program returns 0.
